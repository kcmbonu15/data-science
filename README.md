# My Project
-------------
> **Note:**
> - Final Report Vole Data Analysis 

> - Consider the "microtus" dataset in the "Flury" library in R

> - The present study was intiated by a data collection consisting of eight morphometric 
    variables measured by one of the authors (Salvioni) using  Nikon measure-scope (accuracy 
    1/1000 mm) and dial calipers (accuracy 1/100 mm). The sample consists of 288 specimens
    collected mostly in Central Europe (Alps and Jura mountains) and in Toscana.One peculiar 
    aspect of this data set is that the chromosomes of 89 specimens were analyzed to     identify the specimens
    Only the morphometric characteristics are avaliable for the remaining 199 specimens.."

> - Develop a model from the 89 specimens that you can use to predict the group memebership 
    of the remaining 199 specimens

> - The aim of this project is to implement a classification method, using the Known to classify the unknown, the scope of this project also include the different classifier and combination methods, and evaluate the metric around their performance.
